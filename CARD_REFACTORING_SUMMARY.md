# Animated Card Refactoring Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. **Extracted Common Components**
- Created `BaseAnimatedCard` in `lib/widgets/BaseAnimatedCard.dart` that contains all shared functionality
- Eliminated code duplication between `AnimatedCard` and `AnimatedCardDetailP`
- Both original widgets now use the base component with different display modes

### 2. **Added Editable Fields Functionality**
- Implemented configurable editable fields through `FieldConfig` class
- Fields can be toggled between read-only and editable modes
- Added visual indicators (edit icons) for editable fields
- Tap-to-edit functionality with automatic focus management

### 3. **Display Mode Configuration**
- `CardDisplayMode.schedule` - For schedule page cards (shows subject, subject_code, lecture_no)
- `CardDisplayMode.detail` - For detail page cards (shows lecture_type, formatted dates)

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage (Non-editable)
```dart
// Schedule page card
AnimatedCard(
  animation: animation,
  record: record,
  isCompleted: isCompleted,
  onSelect: onSelect,
)

// Detail page card
AnimatedCardDetailP(
  animation: animation,
  record: record,
  isCompleted: isCompleted,
  onSelect: onSelect,
)
```

### With Editing Enabled
```dart
// Schedule page card with editing
AnimatedCard(
  animation: animation,
  record: record,
  isCompleted: isCompleted,
  onSelect: onSelect,
  enableEditing: true, // This enables editing for all fields
)

// Detail page card with editing
AnimatedCardDetailP(
  animation: animation,
  record: record,
  isCompleted: isCompleted,
  onSelect: onSelect,
  enableEditing: true,
)
```

### Full Customization
```dart
// Using BaseAnimatedCard directly for maximum control
BaseAnimatedCard(
  animation: animation,
  record: record,
  isCompleted: isCompleted,
  onSelect: onSelect,
  displayMode: CardDisplayMode.schedule,
  fieldConfigs: {
    'title': FieldConfig(
      isEditable: true,
      onChanged: (value) {
        // Handle title changes
        print('Title changed to: $value');
      },
    ),
    'date_scheduled': FieldConfig(
      isEditable: true,
      onChanged: (value) {
        // Handle date changes
        updateDatabase('date_scheduled', value);
      },
    ),
    // Other fields remain non-editable
  },
)
```

### Advanced Usage Examples
```dart
// Fully editable card
EditableAnimatedCard(
  animation: animation,
  record: record,
  isCompleted: isCompleted,
  onSelect: onSelect,
  displayMode: CardDisplayMode.schedule,
  onFieldChanged: (fieldName, newValue) {
    // Handle any field change
    print('Field $fieldName changed to: $newValue');
  },
)

// Partially editable card (only specific fields)
PartiallyEditableAnimatedCard(
  animation: animation,
  record: record,
  isCompleted: isCompleted,
  onSelect: onSelect,
  displayMode: CardDisplayMode.detail,
  editableFields: {'date_scheduled', 'date_learnt'}, // Only these fields are editable
  onFieldChanged: (fieldName, newValue) {
    // Handle specific field changes
    updateRecord(fieldName, newValue);
  },
)
```

## Benefits

### Code Reduction
- **Before**: ~174 lines in AnimatedCardDetailP + ~164 lines in AnimatedCard = 338 lines
- **After**: ~200 lines in BaseAnimatedCard + ~50 lines in both wrappers = ~300 lines
- **Savings**: ~40 lines + eliminated duplication

### Maintainability
- Single source of truth for card layout and animations
- Changes to card styling/behavior only need to be made in one place
- Consistent behavior across all card types

### Flexibility
- Easily toggle editing on/off for any field
- Simple configuration through `FieldConfig`
- Support for custom change handlers
- Easy to add new card variants

### Extensibility
- Can easily add new display modes
- Simple to add new field types
- Configurable field validation (can be added to FieldConfig)
- Support for different input types (dates, dropdowns, etc.)

## Migration Guide

### For Existing Code
1. **No breaking changes** - Existing `AnimatedCard` and `AnimatedCardDetailP` usage remains the same
2. **To enable editing** - Add `enableEditing: true` parameter
3. **For custom behavior** - Use `BaseAnimatedCard` directly or the helper widgets

### Future Enhancements
- Add field validation
- Support for different input types (date pickers, dropdowns)
- Keyboard shortcuts for editing
- Undo/redo functionality
- Batch editing capabilities
